RYMVIKINGER is a textbased adventure game about Neo-vikings and a great calamity that befell their vessel. As the last non-mutated viking aboard the ship, you are tasked with shutting down the ship, and purging the universe of mutated vikings.

RYMVIKINGER was created for our course on object oriented programming, and thus implements many features common to OOP in java. However, RYMVIKINGER still pays tribute to machines of a long forgotten past and trys to install a feeling of nostalga similar to other textbased adventures.
